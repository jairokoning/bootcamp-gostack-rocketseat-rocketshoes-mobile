## Rocketshoes

 This small mobile project  is a sample fake store built with the best technologies of React Native and developed during  the [Rocketseat Bootcamp GoStack](https://rocketseat.com.br/bootcamp).

The objective here was not to build a real ecommerce, but to demonstrate how Redux and Redux Saga could be used in order to help in the development of applications that need to share states between components.

The fake data comes from [Json Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## Some of the technologies used

 - react-native
 - react-navigation
 - styled-components
 - axios
 - redux
 - reactotron
 - redux-saga
 - and many others...
